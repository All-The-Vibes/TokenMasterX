"""ContentRouter — detect content type and dispatch to the right compressor.

The router is the engine's front door. It runs cheap, high-precision checks first
(an explicit hint from the caller, then a JSON parse), then heuristics (logs by
line shape, code by keywords+structure), and finally falls back to prose. Prose is
the weakest, most expensive lever, so it is the last resort, never the default.

Every compressor is lazy-imported the first time its type is selected, mirroring
graphify_mcp.py: the module imports cleanly even if tree-sitter / llmlingua are
absent, and a compressor that cannot load degrades to ``noop`` (return input
unchanged). The router itself never raises.
